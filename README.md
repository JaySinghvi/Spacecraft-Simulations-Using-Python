This project involved building four spacecraft simulations in Python, inspired by Kerbal Space Program, to explore real-world physics principles. It demonstrated the differences between flat Earth projectile motion and Newtonian gravity, providing key insights into trajectory behavior. A two-stage rocket simulation was implemented around Kerbin (Earth-equivalent) to analyze propulsion and aerodynamic effects, revealing significant impacts on altitude and velocity. The project leveraged advanced Python libraries for numerical computation and visualization, ensuring precise and well-presented results.
